# Train Ticket Checker (Bangladesh)

This app can give you necessary informations about train tickets e.g. ticket cost, time table, trains availability etc.

I made this app as a flutter noobie and without any previous app development experience. So you might experience some issues but I didn't face any during my testing. 
Below are the screenshots of the app.
